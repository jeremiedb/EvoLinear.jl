Can be one of:\n:mse\n:logistic\n:poisson\n:gamma\n:tweedie\nnrounds=10: maximum number of training rounds.\neta=1: Learning rate. Typically in the range [1e-2, 1].\nL1=0: Regularization penalty applied by shrinking to 0 weight update if update is < L1. No penalty if update > L1. Results in sparse feature selection. Typically in the [0, 1] range on normalized features.\nL2=0: Regularization penalty applied to the squared of the weight update value. Restricts large parameter values. Typically in the [0, 1] range on normalized features.\nrng=123: random seed. Not used at the moment.\nupdater=:all: training method. Only :all is supported at the moment. Gradients for each feature are computed simultaneously, then bias is updated based on all features update. \ndevice=:cpu: Only :cpu is supported at the moment.\n\nInternal API\n\nDo config = EvoLinearRegressor() to construct an hyper-parameter struct with default hyper-parameters. Provide keyword arguments as listed above to override defaults, for example:\n\nEvoLinearRegressor(loss=:logistic, L1=1e-3, L2=1e-2, nrounds=100)\n\nTraining model\n\nA model is built using fit:\n\nconfig = EvoLinearRegressor()\nm = fit(config; x, y, w)\n\nInference\n\nFitted results is an EvoLinearModel which acts as a prediction function when passed a features matrix as argument.  \n\npreds = m(x)\n\nMLJ Interface\n\nFrom MLJ, the type can be imported using:\n\nEvoLinearRegressor = @load EvoLinearRegressor pkg=EvoLinear\n\nDo model = EvoLinearRegressor() to construct an instance with default hyper-parameters. Provide keyword arguments to override hyper-parameter defaults, as in EvoLinearRegressor(loss=...).\n\nTraining model\n\nIn MLJ or MLJBase, bind an instance model to data with mach = machine(model, X, y) where: \n\nX: any table of input features (eg, a DataFrame) whose columns each have one of the following element scitypes: Continuous, Count, or <:OrderedFactor; check column scitypes with schema(X)\ny: is the target, which can be any AbstractVector whose element scitype is <:Continuous; check the scitype with scitype(y)\n\nTrain the machine using fit!(mach, rows=...).\n\nOperations\n\npredict(mach, Xnew): return predictions of the target given\n\nfeatures Xnew having the same scitype as X above. Predictions   are deterministic.\n\nFitted parameters\n\nThe fields of fitted_params(mach) are:\n\n:fitresult: the EvoLinearModel object returned by EvoLnear.jl fitting algorithm.\n\nReport\n\nThe fields of report(mach) are:\n\n:coef: Vector of coefficients (Î²s) associated to each of the features.\n:bias: Value of the bias.\n:names: Names of each of the features.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/#Training-and-Inference","page":"API","title":"Training & Inference","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api/","page":"API","title":"API","text":"EvoLinear.fit\nEvoLinear.predict_linear\nEvoLinear.predict_proj","category":"page"},{"location":"api/#MLJModelInterface.fit","page":"API","title":"MLJModelInterface.fit","text":"fit(config::EvoLinearRegressor;\n    x, y, w=nothing,\n    x_eval=nothing, y_eval=nothing, w_eval=nothing,\n    metric=:none,\n    print_every_n=1)\n\nProvided a config, EvoLinear.fit takes x and y as features and target inputs, plus optionally w as weights and train a Linear boosted model.\n\nArguments\n\nconfig::EvoLinearRegressor: \n\nKeyword arguments\n\nx::AbstractMatrix: Features matrix.
